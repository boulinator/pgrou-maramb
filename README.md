This android application developed in Java with Android Studio is a school project realized with 5 students in my 2nd year at Centrale Nantes.

The objective of the project was to create an application allowing to place markers on a map in order to associate keywords. These keywords would describe the atmosphere of a place and could be consulted by the user. 

In this repo, you will find my part, the account management of the application: 
- Account creation and checks
- Login and checks

This project follows the workshop of the AAU laboratory, cf https://aau.archi.fr/groupes-de-recherche/mobiance-mobilite-et-ambiances-urbaines/
